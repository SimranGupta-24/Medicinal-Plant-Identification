3.Tools & Technologies Used
    Programming Language: Python
    Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
    Data Handling & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Image Processing: OpenCV
    Dataset Source: Kaggle (Medicinal Plant Image Dataset)
    Model Architectures: CNN, Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG16, InceptionV3)
    Development Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
    Version Control: Git, GitHub

4.Dataset 
    The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains images of different medicinal plant species. It is split into:
    Training Set: 80% of images
    Validation Set: 10% of images
    Test Set: 10% of images
    Data Preprocessing Steps:
    Resizing images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels)
    Normalization of pixel values
    Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to improve model generalization

5.Model Development
    Step 1: Data Preparation
    Apply preprocessing transformations.
    Step 2: Model Selection
    Custom CNN Model â€“ A simple CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

    Step 3: Model Training
    Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
    Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    Step 4: Model Evaluation
    Use Confusion Matrix to visualize classification results.
    Compute accuracy on the test dataset.

6.Implementation & Deployment
    Local Testing Run the model locally using:
    python src/predict.py --medicinal_plant.jpg


7.Current Progress & Next Steps
